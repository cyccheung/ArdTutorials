# TUTORIALS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION

# Arduino Tutorials for Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV)
These tutorials are aimed at learning how to use the modules on a UGV with the following modules:
1. Arduino Nano
2. Beitian-880 GPS & Compass Module (GPS is in u-blox family and compass is an HMC5883)
3. Radio receiver and transceiver (model number unsure as of now)
4. Sparkfun 74HC4051 Multiplexer

## Feedback
I always appreciate any constructive feedback on my code. I am also learning as I go along so if you spot mistakes in my code or explanations or think that something should be explained better, please send me an email and I would be happy to learn and make the appropriate changes.
